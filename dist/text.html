                        <h3 class="h3">Scope of Validity</h3>
                        <p>
                            These General Terms and Conditions for the Use of Discovery App GmbH Services End Users (the “GTC”) govern the use of services (the “Services”) offered by Discovery App GmbH., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Discovery App GmbH, (“DiscoEat”) over the internet, through mobile devices, telephone or other telemedia/telecommunications to non-commercial end users (hereinafter: the “User” or “You”). Agreeing to the GTC either explicitly or by using the Services, a legal Agreement (the “Agreement”) between You and Discovery App GmbH is made.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any deviating, complementary or contradictory terms and conditions issued by You do not apply, even if Discovery App GmbH carries out the Services without reservation in the knowledge of these terms without contesting them.
                        </p>


                        <h3 class="h3">Contractual Relation, Registration Conditions, Registration, Changes to Terms of Use</h3>
                        <p>
                            You must be fully legally competent, or act with the consent of Your legal representative, to use our Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Agreement only applies to the non-commercial individual and is non-transferable. Notwithstanding the statutory rules of information requirements, Discovery App GmbH will not file or store Your data for Your use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unless otherwise agreed, Discovery App GmbH may change or cease the provisions of the Services at any time at its own discretion.

                        </p>
